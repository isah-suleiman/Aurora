*Digging into customer and transaction data to help Aurora Bank grow and stay secure—with Power BI!*

## 1. Project Title  
**Aurora Bank Insights: My Journey to Uncover Hidden Gems**

This project is my adventure into Aurora Bank’s customer and transaction data, where I used Power BI to dig up valuable insights and help the bank connect with people while keeping risks in check.

## 2. Project Overview  
With Power BI as my trusty tool, I explored who their customers are, how they spend their money, and where risks might pop up. I built some awesome dashboards to bring my findings to life, creating a roadmap to help Aurora Bank grow stronger and smarter. Seeing it all come together in Power BI felt like hitting the jackpot!

## 3. Problem Statement  
Aurora Bank was facing a few challenges that needed some detective work:  
- **Who are their customers, really?** They weren’t sure about their customers’ habits, making it tough to offer the right services.  
- **Where’s the cash going?** They were missing chances to grow because spending trends were a mystery.  
- **What’s causing trouble?** Rising debt, transaction hiccups, and possible fraud were ringing alarm bells.  

I jumped in to solve these puzzles and find ways to make things better.

## 4. Data Source  
I got to work with some cool data straight from Aurora Bank’s files:  
- **Customer Stories**: Info on age, gender, where they live, plus their financial health—like credit scores, debt levels, and debt-to-income ratios—and how they use their cards.  
- **Transaction Trails**: Records of what they’re buying, where they shop, how they pay, and any glitches like failed transactions.  
- **Risk Clues**: Details on loan risk scores, debt accumulation, and hints that some customers might fall behind on payments.  

This data was my guide, like a treasure map leading me to the good stuff.

## 5. Methodology  
Here’s how I went about finding those insights, all within Power BI:  
- **Tool I Used**: I relied entirely on Power BI to transform and analyze the data, creating stunning visuals and interactive dashboards.  
- **My Approach**:  
  - I started by exploring the data, playing around with filters to see what stood out.  
  - I grouped customers into different categories to get a feel for who they are.  
  - I built custom DAX measures to calculate key metrics—like debt-to-income ratios, total debt by age group, and transaction error rates—making the insights even more powerful.  
- **How I Did It**:  
  1. I cleaned up the data in Power BI, sorting out messy bits to make it usable.  
  2. I crafted DAX measures to uncover trends, like averaging loan risk scores or summing transaction amounts by card brand.  
  3. I designed dashboards to make the insights pop, with charts and filters for easy exploration.  
  4. I checked in with the bank’s team to ensure my findings fit their goals.  

## 6. Key Insights  
After my analysis, here’s what I uncovered—some real eye-openers!  
- **Who’s Banking with Aurora?** The average customer is 45 years old (46 for women, 45 for men), and most are in the 31-50 age range (around 370 clients per age group). Women make up 51% of the 2,000 clients (1,016 female vs. 984 male).  
- **Money and Spending Habits**: Customers are spending big on Mastercard transactions ($3.38M), followed by Visa ($2.72M), with retail leading the way at $3.6M in transactions. Houston, Texas, is a hotspot with $0.12M in transactions, and chip payments dominate (71.31% of transactions).  
- **Financial Health Check**: The average debt-to-income ratio is 139.36, which is pretty high—especially for the 31-50 age group, who carry $12-13M in debt each. About 24.8% have poor credit scores, and 455 clients have high loan risk scores.  
- **Warning Signs**: Transaction errors are a big issue—1,760 failed due to insufficient balance, and Mastercard has the highest failure rate at 49%. Clients with severe DTI (debt-to-income) risk hold $33M in debt, and those with high loan risk scores carry $22.5M.  

These findings felt like hitting the jackpot, giving Aurora Bank a clear path forward.

## 7. Conclusion / Recommendations  
After all that digging with Power BI, here’s what I’d suggest Aurora Bank do next:  
- **Get Personal**: Focus on the 31-50 age group—they’re your biggest crowd. Since they’re spending a lot on retail (especially $0.12M in Houston), how about some tailored retail promos or partnerships in Texas?  
- **Lend a Hand**: The 31-50 age group is carrying a heavy load with $12-13M in debt. Let’s offer them some friendly financial workshops or debt consolidation options to lighten the burden.  
- **Fix Those Transaction Hiccups**: With 1,760 transactions failing due to insufficient balance (mostly on Mastercard with a 49% failure rate), let’s send real-time balance alerts to customers before they swipe. Maybe we can also check if Mastercard’s system needs a tweak.  
- **Tighten Security**: Clients with high loan risk scores and severe DTI risk are holding $22.5M and $33M in debt, respectively. We should flag these accounts for closer monitoring to prevent defaults and adjust lending criteria for this group.  
- **Keep the Conversation Going**: Use my Power BI dashboards to track these trends live and share them with the team for their next big moves.
